# Patchwerx 16
This is a Commander X16 application for experimenting with
Yamaha 2151 instruments - loading / creating / saving

The tool will eventually allow you to create instruments and save
them in a raw binary fomat easily loaded into other projects for use
as sound effects or instruments used in chiptunes.

Right now, it is in a skeleton state and totally does nothing useful.
